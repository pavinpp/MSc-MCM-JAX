# JAX-LaB: A Python-based, Accelerated, Differentiable Massively Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Library for Modeling Multiphase and Multiphysics Flows & Physics-Based Machine Learning

JAX-LaB is a fully differentiable, accelerated multiphysics and multiphase 2D/3D Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Python library written in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and it provides a unified workflow for forward and
inverse modeling of multiphase flows. JAX-LaB is an extension of [XLB](https://github.com/Autodesk/XLB) and adds support multiphase and multiphysics flows to the original library.

## Key Features
- **Integration with JAX Ecosystem:** The library can be easily integrated with JAX's robust ecosystem of machine learning libraries such as [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax), and many more.
- **Differentiable LBM Kernels:** JAX-LaB provides differentiable LBM kernels that can be used in differentiable physics and deep learning applications.
- **Scalability:** JAX-LaB is capable of scaling on distributed multi-GPU systems, enabling the execution of large-scale simulations on hundreds of GPUs with billions of cells.
- **Support for Various LBM Boundary Conditions and Kernels:** JAX-LaB supports several LBM boundary conditions and collision kernels.
- **Support for Multiphase, Multiphysics and Multicomponent flows**: JAX-LaB can accurately model multiphysics and multiphase flows using Shan-Chen method, simulating complex interface dynamics without tracking any interface.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Written entirely in Python, JAX-LaB emphasizes a highly accessible interface that allows users to extend the library with ease and quickly set up and run new simulations.
- **Leverages JAX Array and Shardmap:** The library incorporates the new JAX array unified array type and JAX shardmap, providing users with a numpy-like interface. This allows users to focus solely on the semantics, leaving performance optimizations to the compiler.
- **Platform Versatility:** The same JAX-LaB code can be executed on a variety of platforms including multi-core CPUs, single or multi-GPU systems, TPUs, and it also supports distributed runs on multi-GPU systems or TPU Pod slices.
- **Visualization:** JAX-LaB provides a variety of visualization options including in-situ on GPU rendering using [PhantomGaze](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze).

## Capabilities
### Multiphase Flow Modeling
**Shan-Chen** pseudopotential method with various modifications:
- Support for **high density ratio flows** (tested for density ratios > 10<sup>8</sup>) using improved forcing scheme.
- Incorporates **Equation of State (EOS)** to model multiphase flows. Currently implemented EOS include **Carnahan-Starling**, **Peng-Robinson**, **Redlich-Kwong**, **Redlich-Kwong-Soave**
and **VanderWaals**.
- **Density ratio independent surface tension** control by directly modifying pressure tensor.
- **Improved wetting scheme** to handle large range of contact angles **without large spurious current or thick layers near solid surface**.
### Multicomponent Flow Support
JAX-LaB takes advantage of *pytrees* for computation hence, it can **model any number of components** (each with their own equation of state, initial condition and boundary conditions) without any
user modification.

## Wetting model
- Wetting behavior of fluids is modeled using the [improved virtual density scheme](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.053313) which avoids the need to include separate fluid-solid interaction forces commonly seen in Shan-Chen method by directly updating the near-wall densities
- Wetting parameters can be passed by user while defining wall boundary conditions.

### Collision Models
- **BGK**
- **Multi-Relaxation Time (MRT)**
- **Cascaded Model**
- **KBC**

### Lattice
- D2Q9
- D3Q19
- D3Q27

### Machine Learning

- Easy integration with JAX's ecosystem of machine learning libraries
- Differentiable LBM kernels both for single and multiphase flows
- Differentiable boundary conditions

### Compute Capabilities
- Distributed Multi-GPU support
- Mixed-Precision support (store vs compute)
- Out-of-core support (coming soon)

### Output

- Binary and ASCII VTK output (based on PyVista library)
- In-situ rendering using [PhantomGaze](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/PhantomGaze) library
- [Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax)-based distributed asynchronous checkpointing
- Image Output
- 3D mesh voxelizer using trimesh

### Boundary conditions

- **Equilibrium BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are assumed to be in at equilibrium. Can be used to set prescribed velocity or pressure.

- **Full-Way Bounceback BC:** In this boundary condition, the velocity of the fluid populations is reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in zero fluid velocity at the boundary.

- **Half-Way Bounceback BC:** Similar to the Full-Way Bounceback BC, in this boundary condition, the velocity of the fluid populations is partially reflected back to the fluid side of the boundary, resulting in a non-zero fluid velocity at the boundary.

- **Do Nothing BC:** In this boundary condition, the fluid populations are allowed to pass through the boundary without any reflection or modification.

- **Zouhe BC:** This boundary condition is used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary.
- **Regularized BC:** This boundary condition is used to impose a prescribed velocity or pressure profile at the boundary. This BC is more stable than Zouhe BC, but computationally more expensive.
- **Extrapolation Outflow BC:** A type of outflow boundary condition that uses extrapolation to avoid strong wave reflections.

- **Interpolated Bounceback BC:** Interpolated bounce-back boundary condition due to Bouzidi for a lattice Boltzmann method simulation.

- **Convective Outflow BC**: Convective outflow boundary condition, useful for porous media flows.

**Note:** We encountered challenges when executing XLB on Apple GPUs due to the lack of support for certain operations in the Metal backend. We advise using the CPU backend on Mac OS. We will be testing XLB on Apple's GPUs in the future and will update this section accordingly.
